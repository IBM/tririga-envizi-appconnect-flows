This solution adds four fields that hold the group name values and the path for the integration. It also makes sure that the payload is sent when there is an update.

### Security Role Configuration
In order to properly configure Tririga, a user needs to be configured with the proper security access for Object Migration and Tririga APIs

#### Object Migration Access

Begin by creating a Security Group with the proper application access. Go to Tools -> Administration -> Security Manager

<img width="1076" alt="Security Manager" src="https://media.github.ibm.com/user/348712/files/ba5bd700-1a45-11ed-8b1a-3cf09869b74b">

Click 'Add' to create a new security group or modify an existing group by clicking on the desired group. Fill in the information on the 'General' tab in the pop-up that opens.

<img width="999" alt="Admin Group General Info" src="https://media.github.ibm.com/user/348712/files/ba5bd700-1a45-11ed-8b04-38ab22d7568b">

Switch to the 'Access' tab and add the appropriate access to allow for importation of Object Migration Packages. There are 2 panes in 'Access': Object and Permissions. Scroll and find the Object Migration Object on the left pane and click 'Full Access' on the right pane.

<img width="1002" alt="Access Permissions" src="https://media.github.ibm.com/user/348712/files/baf46d80-1a45-11ed-924e-acda1e9bfe24">

The users in this group, granted through the Members tab, will be able to import the Tririga API Object Migration package. 

Please refer to official IBMÂ® Tririga documentation for more information on Object Migration: 

https://www.ibm.com/docs/en/tap/3.6.1?topic=objects-object-migration-overview  

### Import OM Package

Import the most recent [OM Package](https://github.com/IBM/tririga-api/tree/main/docs/ompackages) into the Tririga instance. Go to Tools -> Administration -> Object Migration and select 'New Import Package' to begin the import process.

### Tririga API User Access

Once the OM Package is imported into the environment, a Tririga user is needed to make the API calls. The user will need certain user permissions based on which Tririga Modules they need to interact with. The Tririga API allows for both Inbound and Outbound traffic.

#### Outbound Traffic from Tririga

For outbound traffic from Tririga, grant at least READ access on the Business Objects that will be used. The table below shows the various supported business Objects the API can pull from: 

Module | Business Object Label
--|--
Asset | [Building Equipment](https://github.com/IBM/tririga-api/blob/main/markdowns/Asset.md)
Classification | [Request Class](https://github.com/IBM/tririga-api/blob/main/markdowns/RequestClass.md)
Classification | [Space Class Current](https://github.com/IBM/tririga-api/blob/main/markdowns/SpaceClass.md)
Classification | [Asset Spec Class](https://github.com/IBM/tririga-api/blob/main/markdowns/AssetSpecClass.md)
People | [People](https://github.com/IBM/tririga-api/blob/main/markdowns/People.md)
Location |[Property](https://github.com/IBM/tririga-api/blob/main/markdowns/Property.md)
Location |[Building](https://github.com/IBM/tririga-api/blob/main/markdowns/Building.md)
Location |[Floor](https://github.com/IBM/tririga-api/blob/main/markdowns/Floor.md)
Location |[Space](https://github.com/IBM/tririga-api/blob/main/markdowns/Space.md)
Organization |[Organization](https://github.com/IBM/tririga-api/blob/main/markdowns/Organization.md)
Request |[Service Request](https://github.com/IBM/tririga-api/blob/main/markdowns/ServiceRequest.md)
Task |[Work Task](https://github.com/IBM/tririga-api/blob/main/markdowns/WorkTask.md)

In the example below, the API user is able to pull data from the Property Business Object: 

<img width="1097" alt="Outbound Business Object" src="https://media.github.ibm.com/user/348712/files/baf46d80-1a45-11ed-8a28-9250be0c8e21">

#### Inbound traffic to Tririga

For inbound traffic, Data Access needs to be enabled and Application Access permissions to the triAPIConnect Module or the individual Objects. To enable an API user to create an organization, grant access to the triAPICOrganization Business object as shown below: 

<img width="1000" alt="Inbound Traffic Business Object" src="https://media.github.ibm.com/user/348712/files/bb8d0400-1a45-11ed-99b1-f598efa63db1">

In addition to Data Access and Application access, the API user also needs to have appropriate license(s) to make these calls. Please refer to the Tririga Documentation on Security and Licenses by following this link: 

https://www.ibm.com/docs/en/tap/3.6.1?topic=platform-license-files 


Additional information on Tririga Security groups can be found here: 

https://www.ibm.com/docs/en/tap/3.6.1?topic=security-groups 




## Group Name Configuration



### Data Modeler

Go to Tools -> Builder Tools -> Data Modeler and using the Object Browser navigate to Location->triBuilding.

Revise the BO and add four fields: cstEnviziParentOneTX, cstEnviziParentTwoTX,
cstEnviziParentThreeTX and cstEnviziGroupNamePathTX

<img width="512" alt="Data Modeler Fields" src="https://media.github.ibm.com/user/348712/files/3ddd5780-09b5-11ed-9014-fbd85b21e6eb">

Name and Label should be the following:

Name | Label
--|--
cstEnviziParentOneTX | Envizi Group 1

Click Save. Logout and Login again to the system

### How to use

This tool will allow user to make changes on this new Envizi group name fields. But we must consider the existing records too. If you want those records to be populated, there is a patch helper workflow that can handle that.

The first this that must be defined is which fields will be used to populate groups 1, 2 and 3 to be used on envizi. To access the envizi tool, go to Tools -> System Setup -> Integration -> Envizi Integation.

When you open the page, the fieldswill be displayed as group1/group2/group3. By default the values are World Region/Country/City. The field Envizi Hierarchy Path shows how the envizi groupnames will be configured according to the selected option. 

Enable Envizi checkbox is available too. The envizi tab will be displayed only when this checkbox is marked

One more item that must be configured is the Number of levels to be used on the envizi configuration. Envizihierarchy path will match this selection.

<img width="1000" alt="How-to-use" src="https://media.github.ibm.com/user/348712/files/21cd6380-3a95-11ed-800d-aa0c22556421">

Also, notice that there is a section named âActive/Retire with missing dataâand âDraft/Revision with Missing Dataâ. This section will list the buildings that donât have data defined for envizi group 3, so it means that no envizi group will be populated on those buildings.


You can filter to change only the desired records by changing query âcst -triBuilding -Query -Get All Buildings for enviziâ. The list of buildings displayed on this query will be the listof buildings that the patch helper will modify.

To use the tool, just select the desired envizi group names and click Save. On the moment Save is triggered, all buildings will be populated with the desired options. This process may take a few minutes depending on how many buildings you have on your system. After that envizi groups and path will be updated according to the selections made on Envizi Integration page.

Also, every time a building is saved and there are changes on the defined fields, or a new building is created, the envizi groups and path will be modifiedaccording to the selected options. You can find the groups on tab Envizi on the building record
